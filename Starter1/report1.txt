Scanner: readme

Challenge Faced:

- Starter code did not build when we got it, we have to debug it to make it work
- Makefile removed some of the source files, making debugger hard to reference
- Handout was vague, has to reference some of the rules according to C.
- Minimum support of flex is presented

Corner cases:
-comments are skipped by scanner and a token "COMMENT" will be returned 
-If integer exceeds it maximum range, report lexical error.
-If floating point exceeds it maximum range, report lexical error.
-If char adjoin with integer or floating point, report lexical error. (Example:222abc)
-If constant with more than one digits starting with 0, report lexical error.
        INT:([1-9][0-9]*)|0
        FLOAT:([1-9][0-9]*)|0)"."[0-9]*)|("."[0-9]+)
