Lab2 Report

Breakdown of Work

Challenges Faced
1. Starter files given by the course cannot built, seems like it persists the problem that lab1 starter has.
2. Difficult to debug the parser since the code is generated using bison
3. Resolve reduce/reduce error and shift/reduce error by reorganizing context-free grammar.

Overall Approach Taken
1. Built the starter
2. Implement context free grammer according to the grammer given in the lab instruction
3. Resolve any conflicts
4. Tests with some miniGLSL shader code

Verification
1. Compiler testing shader file with -Tp option
2. Compare the trace output with the source file
