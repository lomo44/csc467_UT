Approach to AST structure
- For non-terminals, we create a normal nodes which contains parent and childnodes
- For terminals, we create a leaf nodes and store either its literal value, or identifier
  name inside the node.
- Since the parsing is done is bottom-up fasion, the construction of AST is also down in bottom-up
  fashion. When the parser is reducing a production rule ,we create a node for it and connect its 
  relavent child nodes. The whole class structure could be define as below
  cpBaseNode: Base node class for either leaf node or normal node, contains common interface for both leaf and normal node
  cpNormalNode: Derived from base node, contains dynamic allocated children nodes array. Its initialization funciton is virtual
                so that we could initialize different kind of normal node in different way.
  cpBinaryExpressionNode,cpIfStatementNode...etc: Derived from cpNormalNode, contain corresponding childnodes.
  cpIntNode,cpFloatNode,cpIdentifierNode: Derived from cpBaseNode directly, contain either float, int, or string type value.


Approach to type/semantic checking
- After construction of AST, we construct an global symbol table by in-order traversing the AST. At the same type, any identifier
  type is being propagated through the tree. If there are any re-declaration and use of undeclarede variable, we discover the error
  and set a invalid terminal type to either declaration node or identifier node. Pre-defined variables are also loaded into the 
  global symbol table in this stage
- Semantic checking then is done in a bottom-up pattern. For any expression node, we need to reduce its final terminal type to proceed
  the checking. If any of error happen, we print out the error and set its terminal type to an "any" type so that we could dectect more
  error. For any declaration or statement,function calls, or constructor. We check if its arguments is accepted by the grammar. If not, 
  then the error is thrown.

Breakdown of work
Li Zhuang: AST constructing, semantic checking
Gao Chen: symbol table constructing,semantic checking, validation of semantic checking

Challenges faced
- Large code structure
- Defining proper interface for the nodes
- Hard to make sure every single semantic checking is working properly
